# 🎯 Scope & Dependencies Module

## 🔍 IDENTIFYING FRONTEND vs BACKEND (MANDATORY)

**Before estimating, ALWAYS separate frontend from backend work:**

### ✅ FRONTEND WORK (Estimate These)

#### UI Components & Pages

- ✓ Forms, inputs, buttons, modals, dialogs
- ✓ Tables, lists, cards, grids
- ✓ Navigation menus, breadcrumbs, sidebars
- ✓ Dashboards, charts, data visualizations
- ✓ Search UI, filter panels, dropdowns
- ✓ Loading states, skeletons, spinners
- ✓ Error messages, validation feedback
- ✓ Responsive layouts, mobile views
- ✓ Tooltips, popovers, notifications
- ✓ Tabs, accordions, carousels
- ✓ Progress bars, steppers
- ✓ Empty states, placeholder content

#### Frontend Logic

- ✓ Client-side validation (before API call)
- ✓ Form state management
- ✓ UI state (open/closed, show/hide, active/inactive)
- ✓ Route navigation, redirects
- ✓ Local storage, session storage, cookies (client-side)
- ✓ Frontend data filtering/sorting (client-side)
- ✓ Animation, transitions, effects
- ✓ Debouncing, throttling (UI responsiveness)
- ✓ Drag-and-drop interactions
- ✓ Keyboard shortcuts, accessibility
- ✓ Infinite scroll, virtual scrolling
- ✓ Client-side search (local data)

#### Integration (Frontend Side ONLY)

- ✓ API call UI (loading, error, success states)
- ✓ Display API response data in UI
- ✓ Send data to API (form submission UI)
- ✓ File upload UI with progress indicators (not server processing)
- ✓ WebSocket client connection (not server)
- ✓ Error handling UI (retry, fallback)
- ✓ API response parsing for display
- ✓ Request interceptors (adding auth headers in UI)

## 🚫 STRICT SCOPE GUARD (MANDATORY)

**HARD RULE — ALWAYS ENFORCE:**

If the requirement document contains ANY backend, database, infrastructure, or native mobile work:

### Response Template

```markdown
⚠️ SCOPE EXCLUSION NOTICE

The following items are OUT OF SCOPE for this frontend estimation:

❌ BACKEND TASKS (Not Included):

- [List specific API, database, server-side logic items from requirements]
- Backend team should estimate these separately

❌ INFRASTRUCTURE TASKS (Not Included):

- [List specific DevOps, hosting, deployment items]
- DevOps team should estimate these separately

❌ NATIVE APP TASKS (Not Included):

- [List specific Android/iOS native development items]
- Mobile team should estimate these separately

✅ FRONTEND ESTIMATE INCLUDES:

- [List what IS included: UI components, pages, client-side logic]
- All user-facing web UI elements and interactions
- Client-side state management and routing
- API integration UI (loading states, error handling)
```

---

## 📡 MANDATORY DEPENDENCY ASSUMPTIONS

### API Dependency Assumption (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS include this assumption section in estimates:**

```markdown
📡 API DEPENDENCY ASSUMPTION

This frontend estimation assumes:

✅ REQUIREMENTS:

- Backend REST APIs are fully developed and documented
- API contracts (request/response schemas) are finalized
- API endpoints are stable and tested
- Authentication/authorization endpoints are ready
- WebSocket endpoints are documented (if required)
- API error codes and messages are defined
- File upload/download endpoints are functional

⚠️ IF APIs ARE NOT READY:

- Add +25-35% buffer for API mocking and integration rework
- Frontend development may be blocked or delayed
- Consider parallel development with mock data
- API changes during development require CHANGE REQUEST

��� API CHANGES DURING DEVELOPMENT:
API changes after estimation approval will require a formal CHANGE REQUEST
and may significantly impact timeline and hours.
```

### Design Dependency Assumption (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS include this assumption section in estimates:**

```markdown
🎨 DESIGN DEPENDENCY ASSUMPTION

This frontend estimation assumes:

✅ REQUIREMENTS:

- UI/UX designs are complete (Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD)
- All screens, modals, and states are designed
- Interactive states documented (hover, active, disabled, loading, error)
- Responsive breakpoints specified (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Design system/component library defined
- Typography, colors, spacing tokens provided
- Icon set finalized
- Animation/transition specifications provided

⚠️ IF DESIGNS ARE NOT COMPLETE:

- Add +35-50% buffer for design iterations
- Designer-developer handoff time needed
- Expect multiple revision cycles
- Developer interpretation may not match expectations

🚨 DESIGN CHANGES AFTER DEVELOPMENT STARTS:
Design changes after estimation approval will require a formal CHANGE REQUEST
and may result in rework (potentially 30-60% of affected components).
```

### Technology Risk Assumption

```markdown
🔧 TECHNOLOGY ASSUMPTIONS

This frontend estimation assumes:

✅ TECHNOLOGY STACK:

- Framework: [Vue 3 / React 18 / etc.] is confirmed
- UI Library: [Vuetify / Material UI / etc.] is approved
- State Management: [Pinia / Redux / etc.] is determined
- Build Tool: [Vite / Webpack / etc.] is configured
- Testing Framework: [Vitest / Jest / etc.] is set up

⚠️ TECHNOLOGY CHANGES:

- Switching frameworks mid-project: +40-60% impact
- Major version upgrades: +15-25% for migration
- New unfamiliar libraries: +20-30% learning curve
```

### How to Identify Frontend vs Backend

**Ask yourself:**

| If the task involves...    | It's Frontend | It's Backend |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| What users **see**         | ✅            |              |
| What users **click**       | ✅            |              |
| How data is **displayed**  | ✅            |              |
| **Loading/error UI**       | ✅            |              |
| **Client-side validation** | ✅            |              |
| **Server-side validation** |               | ✅           |
| **Database queries**       |               | ✅           |
| **Business calculations**  |               | ✅           |

| **File processing**        |               | ✅           |
| **API endpoints**          |               | ✅           |

**Gray Areas (Frontend + Backend):**

| Feature        | Frontend Part                             | Backend Part                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| File Upload    | Upload UI, progress bar, preview          | File storage, processing, virus scan        |
| Search         | Search input, results display, filters UI | Database query, indexing, ranking           |
| Authentication | Login form, error messages, redirect      | Token generation, password hashing, session |
| Real-time      | WebSocket client, UI updates              | WebSocket server, message routing           |
| Validation     | Immediate feedback, format check          | Business rules, duplicate check             |

**Rule of Thumb:**
If it runs in the browser → Frontend
If it runs on the server → Backend
